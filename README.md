## Code Snippet

async function searchlyrics(artist, title) {
  let res = await axios.get(`https://api.lyrics.ovh/v1/${artist}/${title}`)
  console.log(res.data);
  lyricdiv.innerHTML = res.data.lyrics
The async function successfully grabs the API info(lyrics) on demand of the user input and displays it on the page. 
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left">
      <h1 style="color:#623911 ;font-size:60px;">WELCOME TO THE LYRIC BAR!!!</h1>
    </marquee>
The html marquee successfully scrolls text across the page. 
}
